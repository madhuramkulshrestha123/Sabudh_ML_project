# Sabudh_ML_project
Project Details:
In the English Premier League, May - July represents a lull period due
to the lack of club football. What makes up for it, is the intense
transfer speculation that surrounds all major player transfers today.
An important part of negotiations is predicting the fair market price
for a player. You are tasked with predicting this Market Value of a
player using the data provided below

# Tasks:
1. Use Seaborn to investigate the data and present your
findings 
2. Build models using all the algorithms above to predict
market_value 
3. Tune the hyperparameters and build the most accurate
model 
4. Use model selection approaches discussed in class to
choose the best model 
5. Implement a Genetic Algorithm for learning attribute
weights for the Nearest Neighbour Algorithm. Implement at
least one mechanism for maintaining Diversity within the
Population 
6. Deploy your model as a RESTful Web Service
